# New-York-Parks-Crime-Analysis
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
You're a data scientist working for a laundry-pickup services startup. This is a relatively small company and they cannot compete with the big players in major cities. The company has a strong presence in 140 locations and recently opened stores in 10 new cities. The company has two separate sales regions.

### Methods Used

## Project Description
You have been hired by a community forum to analyze crime incidents occurring at New York City (NYC) parks. This is in support of their efforts to lobby for safer parks. We need to design an attention-grabbing visualization which they will use to motivate for more police patrols in NYC public parks.

We are required to analyze the crime incidents reported to the NYPD, which have occurred at NYC parks during the first quarter of 2018. We have been supplied the data, but unfortunately the data is only available in PDF format. (Central Park is not included).

Furthermore, they require the results to be displayed using a map and it needs to include the actual park layout and size.

Ensure proper use of tooltips and filtering by borough.

## *Disclaimer:* The case study was developed for educational purposes. Any reference to real fact or real events is purely coincidence.
# Findings:
Below is attached the image requested per the description. It's a heat map of all the parks within New York (excluding Central Park) filtered by boroughs and number of incidents.
